## Extension Context Data

Using context data methods allows your extension to remember user preferences or configuration settings, providing a seamless and personalized experience each time the extension is loaded.

For more details on the Looker Extension API and best practices, see the [official Looker documentation](https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/extension-framework-react-and-js-code-examples).

### Extension Context Data Example

1. **Loading Existing Data**  
   When the component mounts, it calls `getContextData()` to retrieve any previously saved dashboard IDs. These are then set as the initial value for the `InputChips` component.

   ```typescript
   const config_data = extension_sdk.getContextData();
   const [dashboard_ids, setDashboardIds] = useState<string[]>(
     config_data?.[DASHBOARD_ID_KEY] || []
   );
   ```

2. **Updating Data**  
   When the user adds or removes dashboard IDs using the `InputChips` UI, the `handleChange` function is triggered. This function:
   - Updates the local state with the new list of IDs.
   - Calls `saveContextData()` to persist the updated list.
   - Calls `refreshContextData()` to ensure the UI is in sync with the latest saved data.

   ```typescript
   const handleChange = (values: string[]) => {
     setDashboardIds(values);
     extension_sdk.saveContextData({
       [DASHBOARD_ID_KEY]: values,
     });
     extension_sdk.refreshContextData();
   };
   ```

3. **User Experience**  
   The `InputChips` component provides a user-friendly way to manage a dynamic list of values. By integrating it with the Extension API's context data methods, any changes the user makes are automatically saved and reloaded as needed.

## Looker Components

Looker components are reusable building blocks provided by Looker (now part of Google Cloud) that help developers and analysts create, customize, and extend data experiences within the Looker platform. These components can refer to several things depending on the context:

### Looker UI Components

Looker offers a set of UI components (sometimes called Looker Components or Looker UI Components) that developers can use to build custom data applications, embed analytics, or extend Looker's functionality. These components are typically available through the [Looker Components library](https://github.com/looker-open-source/components), which is an open-source React component library. They provide:

- **Pre-built UI elements** for dashboards, filters, buttons, inputs, and more
- **Consistent design** with Looker's native interface
- **Easy integration** with Looker APIs and data

These components are especially useful for building Looker Extensions or custom embedded analytics solutions.

### Looker Dashboard Components

Within the Looker platform, a dashboard is made up of various components, such as:

- **Tiles**: Visualizations, tables, or text/Markdown blocks
- **Filters**: Controls that let users interactively filter dashboard data
- **Buttons**: For actions like running queries or triggering data deliveries

Each of these is a component that can be configured and arranged to create interactive, informative dashboards.

### Looker Visualization Components

Looker Visualization Components are the elements that display data visually within Looker dashboards and Explores. These components help users interpret and analyze data by presenting it in graphical formats, making trends and insights easier to spot.

### Types of Visualization Components

Looker provides a variety of built-in visualization types, including:

- **Bar charts**
- **Column charts**
- **Line charts**
- **Area charts**
- **Pie and donut charts**
- **Scatterplots**
- **Boxplots**
- **Waterfall charts**
- **Funnel charts**
- **Single value and single record charts**
- **Tables (legacy and modern)**
- **Maps and geographic visualizations**
- **Word clouds**

Each visualization component can be customized with options for colors, labels, axes, legends, and more, allowing users to tailor the display to their needs.

Visualization components are essential for transforming raw data into actionable insights, making Looker a powerful tool for business intelligence and analytics.

### Summary

In summary, "Looker components" can refer to:
- UI elements for building custom apps or extensions
- Dashboard elements like tiles and filters
- LookML model building blocks

For more details on using Looker's Markdown tiles and supported syntax, see the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/using-markdown-in-text-tiles).

## What is `key` in `<ListItem key={dashboard_id} >`?

In React, the `key` prop is a special attribute you must include when creating lists of elements. It helps React identify which items have changed, been added, or been removed, making the process of updating the UI more efficient and predictable.

When you render a list using `.map()`, like this:

```tsx
<List>
  {dashboard_ids.map((dashboard_id) => (
    <ListItem key={dashboard_id}>
      {dashboard_id}
    </ListItem>
  ))}
</List>
```

The `key={dashboard_id}` part assigns a unique identifier to each `ListItem` component. This is important because React uses these keys to keep track of each element between renders. If the list changes (for example, if items are added, removed, or reordered), React can use the keys to determine exactly what changed and update only the necessary elements, rather than re-rendering the entire list.

**Why is this important?**
- Without a unique `key`, React will warn you and may not update the UI as you expect. It might reuse or reorder elements incorrectly, leading to bugs or unexpected behavior.
- The `key` should be unique among siblings. Using something stable and unique like an ID (here, `dashboard_id`) is best. Avoid using the array index as a key unless you have no other unique identifier, as this can cause issues when the list order changes.

**Example:**
```tsx
const items = [
  { id: 'apple', value: 'üçé apple' },
  { id: 'orange', value: 'üçä orange' },
];

<ul>
  {items.map(item => (
    <li key={item.id}>{item.value}</li>
  ))}
</ul>
```

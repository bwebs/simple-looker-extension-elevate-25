# Module 2: Looker Components and Configuration

In this module, you’ll expand your Looker extension by adding configuration features and dynamic navigation. You’ll use the Extension SDK to save and load user preferences, create a settings panel with interactive inputs, and build a sidebar that lets users switch between multiple dashboards.

By the end of this module, you’ll have a fully configurable extension that responds to user input, loads dashboards on demand, and uses core Looker UI components to build a polished, interactive interface.

## Section Outline

- [1. Extension Config](1-extension-config.md)  
  Configure your Looker project, extension manifest, and required entitlements.

- [2. Tabs and Dashboard Switching](2-tabs-and-dashboard-switching.md)  
  Use the Looker Embed SDK to display a dashboard inside your extension.

# Module 3: Filters & Tab Values

In this module, you'll enhance your Looker extension by implementing advanced filtering capabilities and deep linking functionality. You'll learn how to search and load dashboard titles dynamically, configure deep linking between dashboards, and update your extension's manifest with the necessary API entitlements.

By the end of this module, you'll have a sophisticated extension that supports dynamic dashboard discovery, maintains state through URL parameters, and properly integrates with Looker's core APIs.

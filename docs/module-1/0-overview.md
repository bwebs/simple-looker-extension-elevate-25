# Module 1: Getting Started with Extensions & React

In this module, you’ll kick off your Looker extension project using React. You’ll learn how the extension framework works, how to embed a Looker dashboard, and how to pass and persist filter state using React APIs. We’ll also introduce the concept of entitlements and walk through the required setup in your application manifest.

By the end of this module, you’ll have a working embedded dashboard inside your extension, plus a good foundation in React concepts used throughout the rest of the project.
